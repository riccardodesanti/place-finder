# What is 'place-finder' ?
'Place finder' is a simple chatbot that can look for a specific place on the map according to the needs of the user ( the places can be ranked in order of prominence and a maximum distance can be defined ). Afterwards the bot shows a list of ranked places and the user can decide to open an in-app web-window rich of details and from which can also get the directions to reach the place. 

# Why ?
I created this simple project in order to work with the Facebook Messenger Platform APIs, its Buil-in NLP ( which, in the long run, is my actual interest ), Google's Places API and its friends.
As for the hosting platform, I used Heroku ( linking it directly with GitHub and the latter with Atom ).
